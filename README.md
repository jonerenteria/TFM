Data analysis for the Master's thesis

The current repository gathers all the necessary files to run the scripts produced during the MasterÂ´s thesis. Those scripts are on R-markdown format. The necessary data to run those scripts would be available upon reasonable request on the following email: jrenteriaa@uoc.edu. After cloning the repository, you will have to save the sent database into the Data folder. All the figures produced while running the scripts will automatically be saved on the Figures folder. The Rmd documents included are the following: Biomarcador_I_Oxitocina.Rmd (analysis of the oxytocin biomarker after producing a stressful situation to an individual), Biomarcador_II_Cortisol.Rmd (analysis of the cortisol biomarker after producing a stressful situation to an individual), and Section_2.5_ethnicity_simulation.Rmd (simulates the procedure to analyze if the ethnicity is a significant variable while measuring stress). The PDF outputs of the R-markdown files are also included in the main folder. Please, do not move or delate the biblio.bib file, due to its content. The cites (on BibTeX format) from the articles included in the R Markdown files are included in that file and they are necessary in order to create pdf, word or html outputs from the scrips.
